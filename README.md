# TrainController

Train Controller code for Pittsburgh Light Rail Simulation

CODE AND DOCUMENTATION PROPERTY OF BEN TOMASULO UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED

Breathless Bovine was the group name for this project. Omitted were the pieces of code written by the 5 other group members necessary for the full simulation of the rail system, however the functions of these other parts in relation to the Train Controller are described in the documentation and the inputs may be manually overriden for stand-alone testing of the Train Controller.  See documentation folder for further details.

Pieces of the documentation and ideas may be property of the other 5 group members: Stephen Albert, Christopher Paskie, Dom Visco, Jake Lyons, and Mario Pongibove
