# TrainController

Train Controller code for Pittsburgh Light Rail Simulation

CODE AND DOCUMENTATION PROPERTY OF BEN TOMASULO UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED

Block.java and ResponseTNC.java is property of Christopher Paskie

 In this repository is the code and documentation written by Ben Tomasulo for the Pittsburgh Light Rail System Simulation mentioned in my resume.  This portion of the project is referred to as the Train Controller.  Omitted were the pieces of code written by the 5 other group members necessary for the full simulation of the rail system, however the functions of these other parts in relation to the Train Controller are described in the documentation and the inputs may be manually overriden for stand-alone testing of the Train Controller. Breathless Bovine was the group name for this project.  See documentation folder for further details.

Pieces of the documentation and ideas may be property of the other 5 group members: Stephen Albert, Christopher Paskie, Dom Visco, Jake Lyons, and Mario Pongibove
